### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Project title: What makes different people happy
+ This project is conducted by Nelson Lin

+ Project summary: The project involves using classification on tf-idf of a tokenized, stemmed, and cleaned Happy Moments database. Using the model, we investigate the features/coefficients with the most significant weights in order to determine which words are most important to each class of people from the demographic data of the writers.
